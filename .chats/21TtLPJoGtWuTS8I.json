    "content": "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. Sunlight is made up of different colors, each with its own wavelength. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions more than other colors with longer wavelengths, like red or yellow.\n\nDuring the day, when the sun is high in the sky, this scattering causes the blue light to be more prominent, making the sky appear blue to our eyes. At sunrise and sunset, the sun's light has to pass through more of the Earth's atmosphere, scattering the shorter blue wavelengths and allowing the longer red and orange wavelengths to dominate, which is why we see those colors during those times.",
