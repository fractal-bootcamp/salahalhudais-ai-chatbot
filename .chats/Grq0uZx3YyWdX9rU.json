    "content": "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with molecules and small particles in the air. Sunlight is made up of different colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength and is scattered in all directions more than other colors with longer wavelengths, like red or yellow. \n\nAs a result, when you look up at the sky during the day, you see more of the scattered blue light, making the sky appear blue. During sunrise and sunset, the light has to pass through more of the atmosphere, scattering the shorter wavelengths and allowing the longer wavelengths (reds and oranges) to dominate, which is why the sky can appear red or orange at those times.",
