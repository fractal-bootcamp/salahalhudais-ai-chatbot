    "content": "The sky appears blue during the day due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Here’s how it works:\n\n1. **Sunlight Composition**: Sunlight, or white light, is made up of many colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has a shorter wavelength, while red light has a longer wavelength.\n\n2. **Atmospheric Scattering**: When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with gas molecules and small particles. Because blue light is scattered in all directions more than other colors due to its shorter wavelength, it becomes more prominent in the sky.\n\n3. **Viewing Angle**: When you look up during the day, you see the scattered blue light coming from all directions, which is why the sky appears blue.\n\nDuring sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the sunlight passes through a thicker layer of the atmosphere, scattering the shorter blue wavelengths out of your line of sight and allowing the longer red wavelengths to dominate.\n\nIf you have more questions about this or related topics, feel free to ask!",
